# Local Order Parameter Framework for Block Copolymer Transitions

This repository contains codes used to study order - disorder transitions in block copolymers phases - lamellar, cylinder and gyroid. Details of the method used can be found at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b01682

Each folder has a README that describes how to use the code.
